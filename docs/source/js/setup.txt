The JavaScript client interface is contained in a single file: **model_api.js**

Node.js Installation
---------------------

To use the JavaScript client with Node.js, you'll need:

1. Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
2. npm (Node Package Manager) - comes with Node.js

Install the required dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd js
    npm install

Browser Usage
--------------

For browser usage, include the `model_api.js` file in your HTML:

.. code-block:: html

    <script src="path/to/model_api.js"></script>
    <script>
    // Your code using the ModelAPI class
    </script>

.. note::
    When using in a browser, you'll need to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) appropriately on your server.

Running Examples
-----------------

Examples can be found in the `examples` directory. To run an example:

.. code-block:: bash

    node examples/synchronous_example.js

.. note::
    Make sure to update the API credentials in each example file before running them.
